# Jhb City Power Outages (Home Assistant custom integration)

This repository contains a Home Assistant custom integration scaffold for the Jhb City Power Outages service. It is prepared for HACS and includes a minimal working integration, config flow, tests, devcontainer, and CI.

Features in this scaffold
- Integration domain: `awesome_assistant` (internal domain used for the scaffold)
- Sensor platform using an async DataUpdateCoordinator that polls a (dummy) local endpoint
- Config flow for setting the affected area and scan interval
- Tests (pytest) with a minimal smoke test (skipped if Home Assistant isn't available in test env)
- Pre-commit, ruff, mypy configuration placeholders
- Devcontainer for Home Assistant development (integration blueprint style)
- CI workflow for linting, type checking and tests
- `hacs.json` for HACS metadata

Usage
1. Copy the `custom_components/awesome_assistant` folder to your Home Assistant `config/custom_components` folder (or install via HACS once published).
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Configure the integration via Settings -> Devices & Services -> Add Integration -> "Jhb City Power Outages" and provide the affected area and scan interval.

Notes
- This scaffold uses a dummy local endpoint (http://localhost:8080/outages) by default; swap it with the real City Power API in integration options later.
- The integration domain is currently `awesome_assistant` to match the scaffold template; this can be changed but must match `manifest.json` and the package folder name.

Devcontainer (run Home Assistant in-container)

1. Open this repository in VS Code and choose "Reopen in Container". The devcontainer will build an image that includes Home Assistant Core.
2. After the container builds, open a terminal in VS Code. Start Home Assistant with:

```bash
./devcontainer/run_ha.sh
```

3. Home Assistant will use the config directory mounted at `/config` inside the container. If it's the first run, Home Assistant will create a default configuration. You can then add the integration by copying `custom_components/awesome_assistant` into the container's `/config/custom_components` (the repository is already mounted at `/workspace`, and the devcontainer mounts `/workspace/devcontainer/config` to `/config`).

Notes:
- The provided devcontainer is a simple development environment that installs Home Assistant via pip. For full integration tests you may prefer the `integration_blueprint` devcontainer used by many Home Assistant integrations â€” tell me and I can switch to that variant.
